our resource persons will deliver a brief presentation and to kickstart the presentation please welcome Leigh-Anne from Child TIEFOP Jewelry Group thank you everybody and good afternoon thank you for the opportunity for us to share our experience and thoughts with you so let me give you an instruction of what we do on sustainability as a company that is of 96 years of age we've always focused on winning the trust of all our customers and other stakeholders we've been visioning to be the leading global jewelry brand that can trust trusted by all generation and with sustainability we want to focus especially on our future generations as our sustainability purpose reflects we want to be able to work together with different stakeholders in the industry to bring about sustainable transformation of the jewelry industry so as to have shape a more sustainable future for every generation so last year we have reviewed our 10-year commitment which was established in 2019 to completely review and step up our efforts in sustainability and we launched our new blueprint we have jewelry sustainability in 2049 last year 2049 marks our 120 anniversary and it also marks our target year for achieving that zero and our framework is structured around three strategic pillars including environmental people and industry so on the industry side we have our three focus areas that is circled around and we have a variety where we would aim to increase the source of our precious metals from recycled origins and so we have as the first step we will aim to increase the use of recycled gold across all our product portfolio and with also the introduction of collections made with 100% recycled gold in the area of feasibility we have been focusing on ensuring our raw materials coming from responsible sources where our supply chain will engage in responsible practices ensuring that our labor practices and environmental practices that create that impact on the environment and with our team of diamonds we aim to have almost 100% of them traceable to origin by 2049 and we are not just talking about diamonds but also gemstones and precious metals here and we are also transitioning to low impact operation as mentioned we aim at achieving that zero by 2049 with different initiatives that would include also reducing our for-file environmental impact of our packaging materials by 2030 another area that we are looking at lower impact is on the use of harmful substances in jewelry production that is a very common manufacturing process where different chemicals are being used and we want to enhance the safety and reduce environmental impact by replacing or reducing the use of those harmful substances for people we cover not just our own people but everyone involved in our supply chain and also the broader community to ensure that we protect the human rights and ensure our labor practices along the belligerent we also focus on enhancing the family while being of our employees and everyone in the community as a Chinese jewelry company we of course see that as our responsibility to preserve and promote the appreciation of Chinese culture and also to enhance the heritage of Chinese jewelry craftsmanship to ensure the sustainable development of the industry and also of society grooming the next generation developing future talents is also an important aspect so that's another focus area of our people's strategy as an industry leader for many years we also see it as a responsibility to share our practices share our innovation with the industry and work together hopefully to raise environmental and responsive practices standards along the industry so we are looking to establish recycled waste centers and traceable gold standards and also clean production standards with more safer chemical use in manufacturing of our products we already seen some achievements made where we have launched a hundred percent recycled collection more NOLOC products and we're seeing very good response from consumers we are also looking at understanding our anti-verging emissions and working on our department to harmonize each and plan and we have engaged in partnerships such as the Palace Museum in Beiding and Hong Kong and we are seeing collaborations such as the launch of our Palace Museum collection which has been very popular among customers so we hope you can share your feedback with us in the coming hour also and if you're interested you can browse our website for more of our achievements we've just established published our 10 sustainability reports so we welcome you to meet our report to understand more so look forward to more exchange of thoughts and let's keep it up to now thank you thank you very much thank you, Liyaan thank you I think you've proven that sustainability is an infinite journey it doesn't end it's a long term plan from Chow Tai Phu and I believe after that there will be another long term plan coming up right? okay now our next panelist let's all welcome Henry Henry the floor is yours thank you thank you it's good hi everybody I'm Henry yes and I have a slight prepared this is Narell yes sorry thank you yeah yeah yeah so Narell brand that I founded in 2019 and one of our main objectives is like we share with our customers that join us in the journey to be 100% traceable so it's not easy to be traceable in july but so it is a journey but we try to do our best in this area thank you some of the environmental impact that we care for and we try to do our utmost in Narell for example waste generation, water pollution these things are initiative things that we would look at little steps for example limiting use of plastic in the company a bit like the footprint of energy consumption things like that where we plant trees and different initiatives to help with the environmental impact one of the things we also do is miding processing conflicts free minerals and gemstones and this is something that we try to source different suppliers that have conflict free practices like thing-billy process very about for like a silver and things like that that we try to do and consumer awareness so we're always talking about what we're trying to do through social media finding our audience, finding our clients, our niche market what people do care and want to do a long term environment, better environmental impact so a little bit about traceability and responsible mining environmental providing a fair condition for people for sourcing so through low-yields we have the ability to give back to women miners low-yields they support small-scale mining, support women miners teaching them how to mind and also taking them to the market so they can actually make a living and part of the proceeds when we source from them so that they can have a better education for their family and these are some of the initiatives that can be done in jewelry yeah conflict free, we try to do our best through kimbley process there are suppliers out there, you know, even at this show that will be supplying things like this free crystallized gemstone is a Japanese technology that we source also and using recycled gemstones are able to make something very nice and this is something that Nurell will through our campaigns and talk about and try to sell as well as lab-grown diamonds recycled gold would done different initiatives where we take old pieces of jewelry, melt and produce so there's another little bit of things that you can do and the fair trade gold and silver that we worked with fair ever in UK and that's something that we source as well little bits like packaging like I was saying before recycled paper, reducing plastic I've done different packaging in my time in jewelry whether it's in wholesaling or you know, you're looking at 10 years you're probably getting everything in plastic different less sustainable materials so now you can have quite a nice packaging with recycled paper so we have a lifetime buyback program as well so we think of it like as sexuality from sourcing we're in a period being as sustainable as traceable as possible we do the design ourselves, we craft the jewelry through workshops and we ship it ourselves, sell it to our customers and we buy back and recycle it with jewelry as well so just something to you know like it's important I believe in you know to make that circularity to make as sustainable as possible and that's it, thank you Thank you very much Henry, thank you our next panelist, let's welcome Katherine of PICS I find you really one of the finalists for this sustainability awards 2025 by JWA in battery of Lori's rules thank you so much Mary, so before I start, let me ask you one question what makes something beautiful? of course as jam and jewelry professionals we of course know the trace standard, what makes a jewelry beautiful colors, clarity, you know, the make, whatever it is but actually true beauty exists in many different forms back in 2018 when I was about to find my jewelry company I came to a realization that our lives are not just about ourselves it was actually just a series of personal experience that made me think about that so everything we do, everything we say has an impact on other people whether we know it or not so I decided to found a PICS find jewelry with one simple purpose that is to reveal hidden beauty not just in Jamstone but in people and also perspectives we often forgot about that so I started with PICS using under estimated Jamstones and I intentionally paired them with top quality diamond not because I want to have a very distinct pieces but of course it does look beautiful but the main thing is I want to spread the message of diversity what makes something beautiful because we usually in that industry we usually focus on it out you know the big fall, the diamonds, rubies, sapphires and animals we'll point out what about the other turns comes they are also beautiful in their own right I want to use my jewelry company to spread that message and then, so yes, I elevate the lesser known Jamstones to challenge the conventional ideas of value and the conventional ideas of beauty and the standard of what we use to know so let's actually drive my approach to sustainability but it's not about strategy it's a mindset in everything we do so let's start with the things behind our pieces it's the people of course and for jewelry making myself I do focus on all the little details and it's usually not just about the little things that make up a jewelry but also people behind the scenes and it's also about not just in the industry but also people who are in the society who are often neglected so today I have a privilege to work with over 10 artists 10 skill artists who actually help me with making skills and for the 14th side, 100% of our pieces have have the standard people focusing on level known Jamstone or under the standard Jamstone or under value Jamstone whatever you want to put it, but not the big four and half of the shopping budget goes to smaller scale miners because I want to make a change for the light as well so that they know that what they are doing type of impact on others as well not just that they're providing something interesting for us to use but also for me to track that message and beyond materials, I also believe in giving back to the society so as a very small company myself I've been trying my best to give back in whatever way that I can so since 2018 when I started a company I've been okay, I'm poor, but I'm lying without poor values so last year I have expanded that to different charities like TimeOption, TEMPO, the Intrusion Fund, Megicase Current Center, not just to help them to fund financial support but also giving them the opportunity to come to our workshop to do the handmade jewelry themselves not just for them to experience something new but also for them to understand the craftsmanship behind what it's like to work behind the scenes so it's also another perspective that I want to bring people to understand more about the industry to try to break the dairy about the jewelry so they don't just look at that from a distance so it's so unautical so this is an opportunity for them to try and also I have just launched this Jamsung Discovery Trilogy session for that last year I started off with dining session and then I moved to the big three two months ago and then my next spotlight will be on the Leessonong Jamsung, the other Kale Jamsung the reason for that is not just to let them know that hey, there are other beautiful Jamsung out there but also to use my knowledge to let them know apart from the majority there are also on the Leessonong not just in people, the Jamsung, but in the species or in the test package that's something they might not know before that they found beautiful in the future and one key highlight last year was that as long we craft event it is actually a collective jewelry making experience where I invited multiple people from all walks of life most of them have no jewelry back when at all and to transform one piece of 18k gold together can you play the video please? so this was what happened last year so I had over two days I had more than 50 people came to my workshop so some of them were the actual some of them were the actual young adults these are vehicles and I've got young students while young professionals I've even got children to come to my workshop to do this collective jewelry making as you can see some hammered some saw, some students artistic touches on the 18k gold so the main key message for this is to promote social equality and inclusion so the main message is whatever one ambition might not be how other people could be, how other people wanted it but when we work together we can do something better greater than ourselves and the journey is actually messy they don't usually know what they're doing but as long as they know that this is a collective effort they will try to make it beautiful it will transform all the way from a piece of rectangular triangular rectangular 18k gold to two different shades and some of them might thought that their touches are too small that they might not be noticed but actually people came at different times and people will also work people have done before that I want them to embrace what has been done before and I want them to embrace what has been done and I want them to understand that your thoughts might not be how other people wanted it and it might be out of so you have to embrace the change you have to embrace different perspectives and this is the key message I want to spread during the workshop and very successfully it was the people so great and that's why it's one of our ongoing commitment right now regarding the community initiative I actually turn it into a new signature event I actually have just done the second one last month and it's now in the progress of studying stone-scatting and I'm also continuing my commitment of the charity and spending different opportunities where I can use my knowledge and skills to support other people I am working towards the transparency report I want the whole supply chain to be more transparent not that to reveal our trace secrets I think everyone deserve to understand how things are sourced how do we treat our people what kind of impact we have for the community, and for the people around us and of course 이怎么 матери의 handicap이 있나요,

The fidelity has been wedded and obvious, of course we are able to reach out to our audiences with our extensive network of prints sales 0.6000.. 위기상에서 우리가 직접 저쪽 Faernigp 그래서 저는 guessing 뭐지 네. 오늘 센터,eler deceived 남하 사람들이 괜찮from 그 영상으로 점점 다른 Arduino인 줄은 함께 그렇습니다 생각해주세요 내가 제일orer проф인돈 телефон이에요 breakdown assurance 그리고 말 how lend이 당 Chanel de MSA boom18의하면 그리곤iration에 비해서 연직 참시 obrigado Mike 코코넧스 솔직히 너비 이제 더ין cohesive 또 imaginar 각당한 auf 4 물론 você께 10년이나 생각됬죠? 10년 threaten acht일인 것 같아요 지금 하나는 많은 것보다 swoją Lemony는面틴 plate RGB도 railing 가까이ound가 많네요 네, Entivalue chain가 호텔의 연 exchanges 카리 eyesight als 감사합니다? 제가 아이돌이 кас지 하지만 if you want to stop in because you know something that you are like you close to your heart and you want to do something about it I think it's very important to to to to stick with your true value what is important for you what is so important for you that you have to stop this business that you need to think about it and you keep focusing on that path because there will be a lot of challenges and people will say that it is difficult and a lot of people will say that just commercial one and a lot of distraction I would say I mean I didn't mean commercials a bad thing because at the end of the day we are doing business but I think the intention and the value you have to be very very clear about that thank you 10 reads yeah sorry that is a very fascinating story that is a very cool message that kind of gives you drive to continue right it's not going to be easy so that's very very important I will say there is a lot of program cases out there where if you have your very clear messaging like a very clear what your brand is about and a very clear product as well it's very easy for you to communicate that and people understand what you are actually doing just almost like all eggs on one basket is a little bit better than trying to spread that out there are many program cases where brands with single products have managed to sell huge volumes so I probably do that I probably just if I was hiding all over again I would definitely just focus on single product and communicating that as much as I can with consistency so I think other than staying focused and having a very clear vision as a startup who may not have a lot of resources you can try to reach out to help from others like industry partners that industry associations and even for us we have very close relationship with a lot of industry due to the associations and there is a lot of actually support and help once you retail you can see that a lot of organized organizations are in the usual share of the same vision and I'm sure there is a lot of our collaboration opportunities where you don't just work on it by yourself you can seek help and cooperate with others as long as you share the same common vision I'm sure there is a lot of resources for you for example that Seekyo in Europe they actually have just issued the ESG Guard and a lot of that is focused on helping us and things and I'm sure there are other industries associations, local ones, regional ones, that all of us support like that so I would encourage you to open yourself up and collaborate Thank you very much That was an excellent question other questions? Oh yes please Hello, hello, next to me and I'm also in graduate department I'm present this now and I would also like to ask more about sustainability practices so besides like, feasibility, standards like that I would like to know in different parts of the supply chain how you engage your employees to improve and in every part of the journey of producing could you please provide one side for that? This is a question for you How do you create the culture of sustainability living your company? Right Lee Ann? I'll start first Well, something a very good question because it's very important to engage everyone in the organization to help us bring forward our plan and ideas and at Tour 4, we actually do it both ways we talk down to Baltimore from top down we engage all the department has on the leadership team we have a research that exists in the sustainability management committee at the executive level to provide oversight of our system of meeting actions that involve all the different business units and departments and things like that We also set up task forces which of which will focus on the certain focus area and these task forces comprise members again across the organization for example on the sacred code alone we engage people from productions from sourcing to production and distribution and then branding everyone worked together to bring forward a recycled code a long-term code and commitment Baltimore we actually engage in a lot of internal engagement to help our employees understand and become aware of what sustainability needs for everyone and why do we as a company want to do it wasn't it for them we want to be able to ensure that they understand and get an environment to what we are doing and ultimately internalize them back sustainability into everything that we do and we would invite experts to come share knowledge with us and we have ongoing communications about what we do in the system and we have to be able to keep an informed of our progress so we want to be able to reach out to the organization let them know that engage them and you took that would participate in our actions so that it becomes a very powerful force to bring forward our plan I think it's important to get everyone involved for an employer it matters that their voice is heard and that they feel that they are actually a part of the world exactly yeah they feel that they actually participate in the success of the company outside of the organization we also engage our suppliers where we have best practice supplier principles and we would educate and engage with them to understand what our standards are and ensure they are aligned with us and we would review their practices and show them the improvement areas, provide change with them so that in the broader managing area we also hope to be an established culture okay Henry it's your turn? Sure yeah okay so smaller companies, to mid-sized companies the importance of engaging volume employees is very important jewelry is there there's quite a lot of technical parts in making jewelry so if you're working with crossmen generally they're all gone and then if you're doing social media or whatever it is like marketing and things like that you tend to be empowering and younger so it is important to engage them all together and educating the crossmen or who are the technical people of the importance of sustainability generally at a startup level if you're hiring people they need to be quite passionate about trying to make change and trying to do better it was quite important so yeah hiring the right people is going to be a core to success Thank you Kathy So I have different approach, I'm not different approach because it's still like a one-man ban right now so I don't have any employee to engage at this moment but I do see my suppliers, my clients and also all the collaborators as part of the journey to sustainability so whenever I get a chance to spread the message I'll just let them know what I want to do with the brand what I want to do with the knowledge that I know as my job is to knowledge from professionals from the trade and learn it from the seniors one as well just pass it down as well because I got it from free, I should do it for free as well and then part of the journey I think it's really important to get the skill that knowledge to pass down and together with the message that you want and to understand about whatever you do there is an impact to other people I think that's a spirit of sustainability also being generous with your knowledge and being willing to share it because collecting action is needed for it to really have a strong impact but we should not underestimate the strength of one person or one small group because together we deliver something, you know, we create something beautiful Now we have time for one more question, one last question Any questions? No? So I will ask the final question what is the 8th away, the most important lesson that you have learned in your sustainability journey you are on different stages, right? For example, Leon, you've been in this, you've been an expert for more than a decade, right? and then for Henry, you have been open-to-one businesses and you're actually a member of the entrepreneur and you have a different perspective, different ways of looking at things and gather as you've said, you're a one-month person but never and there's an escapee journey impact So what was the lesson that you learned in your sustainability journey so far? That is not because I'm holding a mic So one push of lesson that I learned is the clarity of intention so to let people understand what's your key message because a lot of people might not understand what you want to do, you don't let them know Like at the very beginning, actually before I started my business I was wanting to follow the more commercial path It should be easy for me, it's more familiar because I was putting that kind of background But then because of the personal experience it's a chef might have to have more access to a more meaningful approach And then when I have that kind of chef and people keep asking me why are you using these kinds of jobs as a set of focus? Why do you pad them with the top 40 diamond? Don't you think it doesn't match? I'm like, that's not the key message that I want to bring out Because I think true beauty doesn't exist in only one particular form Just for example, when we talk about beauty in people People might think about big eyes, sharp chants, long legs Why I don't have any of these? But I do think it's beautiful in a way And I do think everybody is beautiful in that own way We just need to know what it is and need to spread that message out And that's what I told that's beautiful right there But focus is really important because there will be a lot of different noise out there Thank you, thank you so much Henry? One of the lessons, I would say I've tried different initiatives in one way Like I make me saucy, more sustainable groups And I've had expectations for them to do well, but fail So I think one of the things is not to try to do too much at the same time Yes, your core message is your branding, your clean messaging is super important And I would just say like everything takes a little bit of time Everything takes a little bit consistency If there's really probably three in a row had five different things that we can talk about But actually probably focusing on one",

gemologist and a jewelry artisan with nearly 15 years of experience she was born in Hong Kong and educated in New Zealand with a double major in marketing and international business from the University of Auckland Katherine believes all natural creations are the perfect combination of art and science driven by curiosity and science commerce, gemology, design and craftsmanship welcome Katherine now before we start our panel session each of our resource persons will deliver a brief presentation and to kickstart the presentation please welcome Leigh-Anne from Child TIEFOP Jewelry Group thank you everybody and good afternoon thank you for the opportunity for us to share our experience and thoughts with you so let me give you an instruction of what we do on sustainability as a company that is of 96 years of age we've always focused on winning the trust of all our customers and other stakeholders we've been visioning to be the leading global jewelry brand that can trust trusted by all generation and with sustainability we want to focus especially on our future generations as our sustainability purpose reflects we want to be able to work together with different stakeholders in the industry to bring about sustainable transformation of the jewelry industry so as to have shape a more sustainable future for every generation so last year we have reviewed our 10-year commitment which was established in 2019 to completely review and step up our efforts in sustainability and we launched our new blueprint we have jewelry sustainability in 2049 last year 2049 marks our 120 anniversary and it also marks our target year for achieving that zero and our framework is structured around three strategic pillars including environmental people and industry so on the industry side we have our three focus areas that is circled around and we have a variety where we would aim to increase the source of our precious metals from recycled origins and so we have as the first step we will aim to increase the use of recycled gold across all our product portfolio and with also the introduction of collections made with 100% recycled gold in the area of feasibility we have been focusing on ensuring our raw materials coming from responsible sources where our supply chain will engage in responsible practices ensuring that our labor practices and environmental practices that create that impact on the environment and with our team of diamonds we aim to have almost 100% of them traceable to origin by 2049 and we are not just talking about diamonds but also gemstones and precious metals here and we are also transitioning to low impact operation as mentioned we aim at achieving that zero by 2049 with different initiatives that would include also reducing our for-file environmental impact of our packaging materials by 2030 another area that we are looking at lower impact is on the use of harmful substances in jewelry production that is a very common manufacturing process where different chemicals are being used and we want to enhance the safety and reduce environmental impact by replacing or reducing the use of those harmful substances for people we cover not just our own people but everyone involved in our supply chain and also the broader community to ensure that we protect the human rights and ensure our labor practices along the belligerent we also focus on enhancing the family while being of our employees and everyone in the community as a Chinese jewelry company we of course see that as our responsibility to preserve and promote the appreciation of Chinese culture and also to enhance the heritage of Chinese jewelry craftsmanship to ensure the sustainable development of the industry and also of society grooming the next generation developing future talents is also an important aspect so that's another focus area of our people's strategy as an industry leader for many years we also see it as a responsibility to share our practices share our innovation with the industry and work together hopefully to raise environmental and responsive practices standards along the industry so we are looking to establish recycled waste centers and traceable gold standards and also clean production standards with more safer chemical use in manufacturing of our products we already seen some achievements made where we have launched a hundred percent recycled collection more NOLOC products and we're seeing very good response from consumers we are also looking at understanding our anti-verging emissions and working on our department to harmonize each and plan and we have engaged in partnerships such as the Palace Museum in Beiding and Hong Kong and we are seeing collaborations such as the launch of our Palace Museum collection which has been very popular among customers so we hope you can share your feedback with us in the coming hour also and if you're interested you can browse our website for more of our achievements we've just established published our 10 sustainability reports so we welcome you to meet our report to understand more so look forward to more exchange of thoughts and let's keep it up to now thank you thank you very much thank you, Liyaan thank you I think you've proven that sustainability is an infinite journey it doesn't end it's a long term plan from Chow Tai Phu and I believe after that there will be another long term plan coming up right",

            "text": "of course as jam and jewelry professionals we of course know the trace standard, what makes a jewelry beautiful colors, clarity, you know, the make, whatever it is but actually true beauty exists in many different forms back in 2018 when I was about to find my jewelry company I came to a realization that our lives are not just about ourselves it was actually just a series of personal experience that made me think about that so everything we do, everything we say has an impact on other people whether we know it or not so I decided to found a PICS find jewelry with one simple purpose that is to reveal hidden beauty not just in Jamstone but in people and also perspectives we often forgot about that so I started with PICS using under estimated Jamstones and I intentionally paired them with top quality diamond not because I want to have a very distinct pieces but of course it does look beautiful but the main thing is I want to spread the message of diversity what makes something beautiful because we usually in that industry we usually focus on it out you know the big fall, the diamonds, rubies, sapphires and animals we'll point out what about the other turns comes they are also beautiful in their own right I want to use my jewelry company to spread that message and then, so yes, I elevate the lesser known Jamstones to challenge the conventional ideas of value and the conventional ideas of beauty and the standard of what we use to know so let's actually drive my approach to sustainability but it's not about strategy it's a mindset in everything we do so let's start with the things behind our pieces it's the people of course and for jewelry making myself I do focus on all the little details and it's usually not just about the little things that make up a jewelry but also people behind the scenes and it's also about not just in the industry but also people who are in the society who are often neglected so today I have a privilege to work with over 10 artists 10 skill artists who actually help me with making skills and for the 14th side, 100% of our pieces have have the standard people focusing on level known Jamstone or under the standard Jamstone or under value Jamstone whatever you want to put it, but not the big four and half of the shopping budget goes to smaller scale miners because I want to make a change for the light as well so that they know that what they are doing type of impact on others as well not just that they're providing something interesting for us to use but also for me to track that message and beyond materials, I also believe in giving back to the society so as a very small company myself I've been trying my best to give back in whatever way that I can so since 2018 when I started a company I've been okay, I'm poor, but I'm lying without poor values so last year I have expanded that to different charities like TimeOption, TEMPO, the Intrusion Fund, Megicase Current Center, not just to help them to fund financial support but also giving them the opportunity to come to our workshop to do the handmade jewelry themselves not just for them to experience something new but also for them to understand the craftsmanship behind what it's like to work behind the scenes so it's also another perspective that I want to bring people to understand more about the industry to try to break the dairy about the jewelry so they don't just look at that from a distance so it's so unautical so this is an opportunity for them to try and also I have just launched this Jamsung Discovery Trilogy session for that last year I started off with dining session and then I moved to the big three two months ago and then my next spotlight will be on the Leessonong Jamsung, the other Kale Jamsung the reason for that is not just to let them know that hey, there are other beautiful Jamsung out there but also to use my knowledge to let them know apart from the majority there are also on the Leessonong not just in people, the Jamsung, but in the species or in the test package that's something they might not know before that they found beautiful in the future and one key highlight last year was that as long we craft event it is actually a collective jewelry making experience where I invited multiple people from all walks of life most of them have no jewelry back when at all and to transform one piece of 18k gold together can you play the video please",

and good afternoon thank you for the opportunity for us to share our experience and thoughts with you so let me give you an instruction of what we do on sustainability as a company that is of 96 years of age we've always focused on winning the trust of all our customers and other stakeholders we've been visioning to be the leading global jewelry brand that can trust trusted by all generation and with sustainability we want to focus especially on our future generations as our sustainability purpose reflects we want to be able to work together with different stakeholders in the industry to bring about sustainable transformation of the jewelry industry so as to have shape a more sustainable future for every generation so last year we have reviewed our 10-year commitment which was established in 2019 to completely review and step up our efforts in sustainability and we launched our new blueprint we have jewelry sustainability in 2049 last year 2049 marks our 120 anniversary and it also marks our target year for achieving that zero and our framework is structured around three strategic pillars including environmental people and industry so on the industry side we have our three focus areas that is circled around and we have a variety where we would aim to increase the source of our precious metals from recycled origins and so we have as the first step we will aim to increase the use of recycled gold across all our product portfolio and with also the introduction of collections made with 100% recycled gold in the area of feasibility we have been focusing on ensuring our raw materials coming from responsible sources where our supply chain will engage in responsible practices ensuring that our labor practices and environmental practices that create that impact on the environment and with our team of diamonds we aim to have almost 100% of them traceable to origin by 2049 and we are not just talking about diamonds but also gemstones and precious metals here and we are also transitioning to low impact operation as mentioned we aim at achieving that zero by 2049 with different initiatives that would include also reducing our for-file environmental impact of our packaging materials by 2030 another area that we are looking at lower impact is on the use of harmful substances in jewelry production that is a very common manufacturing process where different chemicals are being used and we want to enhance the safety and reduce environmental impact by replacing or reducing the use of those harmful substances for people we cover not just our own people but everyone involved in our supply chain and also the broader community to ensure that we protect the human rights and ensure our labor practices along the belligerent we also focus on enhancing the family while being of our employees and everyone in the community as a Chinese jewelry company we of course see that as our responsibility to preserve and promote the appreciation of Chinese culture and also to enhance the heritage of Chinese jewelry craftsmanship to ensure the sustainable development of the industry and also of society grooming the next generation developing future talents is also an important aspect so that's another focus area of our people's strategy as an industry leader for many years we also see it as a responsibility to share our practices share our innovation with the industry and work together hopefully to raise environmental and responsive practices standards along the industry so we are looking to establish recycled waste centers and traceable gold standards and also clean production standards with more safer chemical use in manufacturing of our products we already seen some achievements made where we have launched a hundred percent recycled collection more NOLOC products and we're seeing very good response from consumers we are also looking at understanding our anti-verging emissions and working on our department to harmonize each and plan and we have engaged in partnerships such as the Palace Museum in Beiding and Hong Kong and we are seeing collaborations such as the launch of our Palace Museum collection which has been very popular among customers so we hope you can share your feedback with us in the coming hour also and if you're interested you can browse our website for more of our achievements we've just established published our 10 sustainability reports so we welcome you to meet our report to understand more so look forward to more exchange of thoughts and let's keep it up to now thank you thank you
