Now, Leanne has been the director of Sustainability, a child-type of dual-regroup since November 2023, overseeing the group sustainability strategy development and action-clone implementation across the organization, driving impactful progress in sustainable development. Before joining child-type who, Leanne worked as a sustainability advisor at the purpose business. From 2015 to 2009, she was director of external affairs and sustainability at Baita's own, where she led sustainability strategy development and communications. She also drove waste reduction initiatives, including supporting the establishment of Hong Kong's first beverage-partun recycling facility. Wow. And prior to taking up sustainability roles, the unscarveer span corporate communications and public government and committee affairs had been worked at different multinational companies. So, Leanne, our next panelist, a very, very young entrepreneur, at least welcome Miss Henry. Now, Henry has found that not one, not two, but three companies. So as you can see, Henry actually is CEO of Ankhar Dink, which is a wholesale dual-regroup in my realm, which is a retail brand and they have a store at K11 and also join the day our and so Henry has actually been from a family of dualers and he represents the new, you know, the next generation of dualers.
